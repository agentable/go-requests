# Profile API Specs

## Overview

`Profile` expresses a coherent client identity as construction-time options. A profile may contribute default headers, ordered headers, protocol preferences, transport configuration, and fingerprint hooks.

Profiles are not request builders. They configure reusable client defaults before requests are created.

## Contract

The profile contract is:

```go
type Profile interface {
	Name() string
	Options() []Option
}
```

`WithProfile(profile)` applies the returned options in order during `New` or `Clone`. If a profile option fails, construction fails with profile context.
A nil or typed-nil profile is invalid and returns `ErrInvalidConfigValue` instead of panicking. Nil entries in extension profile option lists are ignored, matching root functional-option composition.

A profile that installs a transport is an explicit whole-transport replacement. Earlier settings that the new transport can consume, such as TLS/session intent, are preserved by that profile. Transport-specific settings it cannot represent, such as TCP dial or HTTP proxy settings on HTTP/3, are replaced. Later incompatible root transport options fail construction instead of silently replacing the profile transport.

TLS options on the `fingerprint` and `http3` profile constructors capture a
standard shallow `tls.Config.Clone` when the profile option is applied. Delayed
profile application MUST NOT retain or mutate the caller's top-level config
pointer. Referenced collaborators retain the ownership rules defined in
`SPECS/20-client-api-specs.md`.

## Scope

Profiles MAY contribute:

- default headers
- ordered headers
- protocol preferences such as HTTP/2
- transport profiles such as HTTP/3
- TLS fingerprint configuration in extension modules

Profiles MUST NOT apply request-local state. Request-local headers and ordered headers continue to override profile defaults according to `SPECS/21-request-builder-api-specs.md`.

## Package Boundary

The root package defines the profile interface and option only. Concrete profiles SHOULD live in small extension packages such as `browser`, `fingerprint`, and `http3`, so root APIs stay stable and do not accumulate browser-version or transport dependency details.

Fixed browser header profiles in the `browser` module MUST name the browser major version they emit, such as `Chrome145` or `Firefox148`. Auto-style fingerprint profiles in the `fingerprint` module may stay unversioned when the exact ClientHello version is controlled by the uTLS dependency.

## Forbidden

- Do not expose browser version details as root package methods.
- Do not use unversioned names for fixed browser header identities.
- Do not make profile application per-request.
- Do not use profile as a general mutation hook.
- Do not silently change TLS verification defaults from a profile.

## Contract Invariants

- Profiles are client-level only.
- Profile errors surface through `New` or `Clone`.
- `WithProfile` preserves construction-time option ordering.
- Unsupported profile/option combinations fail rather than partially applying or changing protocol.
- Request-local metadata overrides profile defaults.
