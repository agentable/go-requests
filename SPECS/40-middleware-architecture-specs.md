# Middleware Architecture Specs

## Overview

Middleware wraps request execution. This spec defines the middleware signature, composition order, and the public behavior of the built-in middleware package.

## Signature

The middleware contract is:

```go
type Middleware func(next MiddlewareHandlerFunc) MiddlewareHandlerFunc
```

A middleware receives the next handler and returns a new handler.

## Composition Model

Middleware may be attached at two layers:

- client layer through `WithMiddleware` during `New` or `Clone`
- request layer through `RequestBuilder.AddMiddleware`

Within each layer, middleware runs in registration order.

Across layers, client middleware wraps request middleware. The effective stack is:

1. client middleware
2. request middleware
3. final HTTP execution handler

If middleware returns without calling the next handler, the transport never owns the prepared request body. `requests` closes that undelivered body after the middleware chain returns, including response, error, and nil-response short circuits.

> **Why**: Client middleware expresses cross-cutting policy for all requests, while request middleware expresses one-shot behavior closer to the transport attempt.
>
> **Rejected**: A single undifferentiated middleware list shared by all requests.

## Built-in Middleware

The `middlewares` package defines:

- `HeaderMiddleware`, which adds headers to every request it wraps
- `CookieMiddleware`, which adds cookies to every request it wraps

## Mutation Contract

`WithMiddleware` contributes client-level middleware during construction or cloning. `RequestBuilder.AddMiddleware` mutates one builder in place and does not return a fluent builder.

## Forbidden

- Do not use a two-argument middleware signature.
- Do not assume `RequestBuilder.AddMiddleware` returns `*RequestBuilder`.

## Contract Invariants

- The middleware function signature is explicit.
- Layering and execution order are explicit.
- The built-in middleware contracts are explicit.
- The construction-time client middleware path and request-local mutator are explicit.
